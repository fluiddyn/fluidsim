# Fluidsim documentation

## Overview

Fluidsim is a framework for studying fluid dynamics with numerical simulations
using Python. It is part of the wider project
[FluidDyn](http://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io).

Fluidsim is an object-oriented library to develop "solvers" (i.e. Python packages
solving equations) by writing mainly Python code. The result is **very efficient**
even compared to a pure Fortran or C++ code since the time-consuming tasks are
performed by optimized compiled functions.

Fluidsim is a [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) code
written mostly in Python. It uses the library
[Fluidfft](http://fluidfft.readthedocs.io) to use very efficient FFT libraries.
Fluidfft is written in C++, Cython and Python. Fluidfft and fluidsim take
advantage of [Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran), a static
Python compiler which produces very efficient binaries by compiling Python via
C++11. Pythran is actually used in Fluidsim through
[Transonic](http://transonic.readthedocs.io), which is a new and cool project for
HPC with Python.

An advantage of a CFD code written mostly in Python is that to run simulations and
analyze the results, the users communicate (possibly interactively) together and
with the machine with Python, which is nowadays among the best languages to do
these tasks. Moreover, it is much simpler and faster than with pure Fortran or C++
codes to add any complicate analysis or to write a modified solver.

We have created fluidsim to be **easy and nice to use and to develop**, highly
**efficient** and **robust**.

Being a framework, Fluidsim can easily be extended in other packages to develop
other solvers (see for example the packages [snek5000] and [fluidsimfoam]).

The list of solvers implemented using Fluidsim (see {mod}`fluidsim.solvers`,
[snek5000] and [fluidsimfoam]) gives a good idea of the versatility of this
framework. The main Fluidsim package contains mostly solvers solving equations
over a periodic space:

- 2d and 3d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
- 2d and 3d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq
  approximation (with a buoyancy variable),
- 2d and 3d stratified Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation
  with constant Brunt-Väisälä frequency,
- 2d one-layer shallow-water equations + modified versions of these equations,
- 2d Föppl-von Kármán equations (elastic thin plate).

## API Reference

A pure-Python package `fluidsim-core` houses all the abstraction necessary to
define solvers.

```{eval-rst}

The package `fluidsim` provides a set of specialized solvers solvers, supporting
classes and functions.
