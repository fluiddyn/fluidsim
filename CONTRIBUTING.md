# How to contribute to FluidDyn and fluidsim

Thank you for considering contributing to FluidDyn. FluidDyn is a
community-driven project. It's people like you that make FluidDyn useful and
successful. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or
examples, improvements to the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature
requests, or even writing code which can be incorporated into FluidDyn for
everyone to use. (paragraph shamelessly taken and adapted from the MetPy
project!)

## Reporting Issues

When opening an issue to report a problem
(<https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidsim/issues>), please try to provide a
minimal code example that reproduces the issue along with details of the system
you are using. You can copy-paste the output of the command `fluidinfo -v`
([Github gists](https://gist.github.com/) are good for that!).

## Development process

For FluidDyn, we use the revision control software Mercurial and our main
repositories are hosted here: <https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn>.

Please read our documentation on [developer
essentials](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advice_developers.html),
and especially on [setting up
Mercurial](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mercurial_heptapod.html).
